This semester in Dr. Woodward's computational biology and bioinformatics class has taught me valuable skills that I will be able to carry into the rest of my career. I am extremely grateful to have had a professor as kind as him! Additionally, my brother is a bioinformatics scientist at Natera and it was fun getting to know what he does. Ironically, my brother's boss has been wanting him to learn R, meanwhile I learned in this class.


Here's a quick demo of python as well as how python and R interact:
