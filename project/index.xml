      <description>#Project 2 ##Sanica Mehta, sgm2384
The data set that I am using is survival of melanoma patients after tumor excision from the boot library. Variables include time, which is the survival time in days after surgery. Status is the status of the patients at the end of the study, 1 being they passed away from melanoma, 2 being that they were still alive, and 3 being that they passed away due to reasons unrelated to melanoma.</description>
